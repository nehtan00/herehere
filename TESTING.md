- [ ] Firebase operations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] Error states handle timeouts gracefully
- [ ] Loading states provide feedback

### 5. Error Handling Testing

#### Network Errors
- [ ] Offline state is handled gracefully
- [ ] API failures show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Retry mechanisms work
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors

#### User Input Errors
- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] Invalid inputs show helpful messages
- [ ] Required fields are enforced
- [ ] Data sanitization works

#### Firebase Errors
- [ ] Authentication failures are handled
- [ ] Firestore read/write errors are handled
- [ ] Permission errors show appropriate messages
- [ ] Connection issues are handled

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Tools

### Manual Testing
- Browser Developer Tools
- Lighthouse for performance and accessibility
- WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator
- Color contrast checkers

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Cypress for end-to-end tests
- Playwright for cross-browser testing

## üìã Test Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All functional tests pass
- [ ] Responsive design works on target devices
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are achieved
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Device Testing
- [ ] Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Tablet (iPad, Android tablets)
- [ ] Mobile (iPhone, Android phones)
- [ ] Different screen resolutions

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Performance Issues
- **Large bundle size**: Check for unused dependencies
- **Slow API calls**: Implement caching and loading states
- **Layout shift**: Use proper image dimensions and loading strategies

### Accessibility Issues
- **Missing alt text**: Add descriptive alt text to all images
- **Poor contrast**: Use color contrast checkers and adjust colors
- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Responsive Issues
- **Mobile layout**: Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Touch targets**: Ensure buttons are at least 44px in size
- **Text readability**: Use appropriate font sizes and line heights
